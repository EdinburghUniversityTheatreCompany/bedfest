Former friends and roommates, Annie and Frances haven’t spoken to each other in more than a year. But sparks fly when Frances shows up at Annie’s door late one April night, drunk and demanding to talk. Buried truths are dragged back up to the surface as the women navigate family expectations, sexuality, and their own ambitions. Will Annie and Frances be able to resolve all of the things left unsaid? Or will the weight of the past shatter any possibility of a future they might have?

### Content Warnings
While this play was written to celebrate queer identities,(especially for female-identifying members of the community) this script does deal with themes of homophobia. No character experiences homophobia onstage, however themes such as internalized homophobia, struggles with parental acceptance of homosexuality, and societal pressures to being homosexual are all touched on.
## Monologue Audition Pieces
> Do not feel like you have to memorise the piece, there will be paper copies available on the day for you to read off from.

### Monologue 1
**FUTURE ANNIE:** In our last year of school together, we lived in a two bedroom basement suite. It was always freezing, so we bought a space heater and huddled around it during the never-ending winter nights. One night we were talking, about something I can’t remember now, and she turned to me with this look in her eyes that was both thrilling and terrifying. I leaned in for a brief moment, wanting to know what she would taste like. And before anything happened, I left. She just sat there. So many things went unsaid, and from then on there was a distance between us. It hurt everyday, because I knew it was my fault, but I had to do it, to keep us both at bay.

### Monologue 2
**FUTURE ANNIE:** There are few things in life better than kissing her. She tastes like strawberries and long forgotten promises. Her touch makes the world spin and time stand still. Every part of me feels alive, and for the first time, I finally understand what it is like to feel at home. Her body melds itself perfectly into mine and I wonder how I went a single day without her next to me. How is it possible that she takes my heart and rests it in the curves of her body, making me feel safe and terrified all at the same time?

### Duologue 1

FRANCES

That day in the church... at my wedding. When you came to see me in the backroom right before I walked down the aisle—

ANNIE

I asked you if it was what you wanted.

FRANCES

And I kissed you.

ANNIE

Yeah. (Beat.) You said you wanted to know what it felt like.

FRANCES

I thought if I pretended long enough with him, it could become real. But then I saw you, standing in the daylight of that church. You looked so lost and alone. And I don’t know, maybe something in me broke?

ANNIE

But you still chose him.

FRANCES

Please, just hear me out—

ANNIE

Whatever, Frances. You were always keeping secrets, even from me.

FRANCES

No more secrets, okay? No more lies.

ANNIE

That’s rich, coming from you.

(Beat.)

FRANCES

I came out, Annie. I told my parents.

(Beat.)

ANNIE

Why are you telling me this?

FRANCES

I wanted to give you an explanation.

ANNIE

But... why now?

FRANCES

I don’t know, I guess I didn’t want to hide anymore.

### Duologue 2

ANNIE

And that’s where you met... him.

FRANCES

He doesn’t mean anything to me.

ANNIE

Of course he means something to you, Fran. You married him. You chose him.

FRANCES

He wasn’t who I wanted. (Beat.) You know who I wanted.

ANNIE

Don’t.

(ANNIE goes to walk away, FRANCES takes ANNIE’s hand)

FRANCES

Please, just hear me out... Kissing you meant more to me than anything I ever did with him.

ANNIE

It was just one kiss, I don’t understand what was so special about it.

FRANCES

It wasn’t just a kiss, and you know it.

ANNIE

If you really thought that, you wouldn’t have walked away.

FRANCES

Will you please just listen to me?

ANNIE

I can’t.

FRANCES

Why not?

ANNIE

If I listen to you, then it’s over.

FRANCES

What is?

ANNIE

This wall that I’ve built around myself, so you can’t hurt me again. The lies that I told myself, that I was better off without you—it all goes away.

FRANCES

I just want you back, Annie.

### Duologue 3

FRANCES

Please, just try to understand—

ANNIE

No! I’m sick of understanding, I always understand! Why is everything always on me?

FRANCES

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.

ANNIE

You won, Frances. You got the life you wanted. I don’t know what more there is to say.

FRANCES

I had hoped you’d forgive me.

ANNIE

Do you think you’ve earned it?

FRANCES

I did. Now I’m not so sure.

ANNIE

But that is why you came here tonight? You wanted me to forgive you?

FRANCES

Yes.

ANNIE

You must not think very much of me.

FRANCES

I think the world of you, you know that. Can’t we just be honest with each other?

ANNIE

Honestly? You coming here tonight was a bad call.

FRANCES

Why?

ANNIE

You aren’t being fair. You’re asking me to forgive you, knowing I can’t say no to you. That I wouldn’t say no.

FRANCES (apologetically)

I know, I know. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone like you.

ANNIE

I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve all the shit you’ve put me through.
